# Basic-Minesweeper


This si a basic Minesweeper. Nice to work with recursion and interact with the DOM. 
Good for a first project, you can analize how this approach is done and think in others. 

It needs a refactor for sure, so if you want to fork it, you have a nice base code to practice this skill. 

Happy hacking!!! :smile:
